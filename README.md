# crecknn (Clustering through Reciprocal kNN graph and connected components)

## Abstract

The huge increase in the amount of multimedia data available and the pressing need for organizing them in different categories, especially in scenarios where there are no labels available, makes data clustering an essential task in different scenarios.
In this work, we present a novel clustering method based on an unsupervised manifold learning algorithm, in which a more effective similarity measure is computed by the manifold learning and used for clustering purposes.
The proposed approach is applied to anomaly detection in videos and used in combination with different background segmentation methods to improve their effectiveness.
An experimental evaluation is conducted on three different image datasets and one video dataset.
The obtained results indicate superior accuracy in most clustering tasks when compared to the baselines.
Results also demonstrate that the clustering step can improve the results of background subtraction approaches in the majority of cases.

## Overview
![Process Workflow](/img/process_image.png)

The **crecknn** works based on three stages:

1. The input data is applied to a [manifold learning algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320317301978) in order to improve the dataset's rankings
2. Based on the new enhanced rankings retrieved from the stage 1, the algorithm is repeated with a low neighborhood size in order to extract high-reliable initial cluster configuration from the dataset
3. The initial clustering configuration is agglomerated based on the enhanced distance measure obtained on stage 1

## Instalation

Clone the repository and enter the project folder:

```
cd crecknn
```

Create and activate a python virtual enviroment:

```

virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the project dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Compile the source files:

```
make
```

After the described steps, you can run the example code in order to check the instalation:

```
python example.py
```

## Parameters and utilization

The **crecknn** contains three main parameters, one being optional:

Parameter | Decription | Default Value
--------- | ---------- | -------------
k | The size of reciprocal neighborhood exploited by the manifold learning algorithm. | 15
ck | The low size reciprocal neighborhood applied on stage 2, in order to retrieve the first cluster configuration from the dataset | 3
min_elem | The minimum number of elements of each cluster after the agglomeration on stage 3. This parameter defines the number of cluster fusions executed by the algorithm | Being optional, the default value will be equal to k

To utilize the **crecknn**, first import the package on your python code:

```
import crecknn
```
(Please note that the python code must be on the same folder where the `make` command was executed)

Then, initialize the cluster object:

```
cluster = crecknn.Cluster(k=15, ck=4, min_elem=10)
```

Finally, insert the input data:

```
cluster.fit(data)
```

Notice that `data` must be array-like and can have shape(n, m), being interpreted as a feature matrix, or shape(n, n), being interpreted as a distance matrix.

After the clusterization, the labels can be retrieve by:

```
cluster.labels_
```
